This is all my work related to a CSCI 110 Beggining Python class at Colorado Mesa University.

Each homework turn in is placed in their respective folders labeled by weeks of assignment.

The final.py file in the final folder is a game created for the final project for the class. The final.py is a tic-tac-toe game which is for 2 players and saves the score on a file.
